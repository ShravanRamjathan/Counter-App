# 🔢 Basic Counter App

This is a simple JavaScript project that implements a **counter** which can:

- ✅ Increase by 1  
- 🔁 Reset to 0  
- 🔻 Decrease by 1  

## 🧠 What I Practiced

- **JavaScript basics**  
- **DOM manipulation** – updating the page dynamically based on user interactions  
- **Event handling** with `addEventListener`  
- Writing clean and understandable code for UI behavior  

## 🚀 How It Works

- The counter starts at `0`.
- Buttons trigger JavaScript functions to increase, decrease, or reset the value.
- The number updates on screen in real time.

## 📁 Files Included

- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`
